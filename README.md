📂 Better Call Monad

“In this world, if your swaps go wrong, your PNL vanishes, or your floor starts collapsing…
there's still someone to call.”

Better Call Monad is a creatively styled dApp discovery interface inspired by the atmosphere of Better Call Saul.
Rather than presenting a typical list of applications, users are dropped into a private lawyer’s office, complete with cinematic sound, animated smoke, and a desk full of case files.

Each folder represents a confidential client case related to the on-chain experience.
Opening a folder reveals curated dApp recommendationsin a formal case-file format — structured like investigation notes.

No dashboards. No lists. Just pure legal drama for degens.

🎬 Concept

Fully immersive UX inspired by the visual language of Better Call Saul

Interactive office room scene (background + audio + animated smoke)

dApps are presented as legal cases, not navigation items

Each case opens as a manila folder with printed documents, including:

A case title

A confidential note

A table-style registry of external solutions ("recommended tools")

Future entries are intentionally marked as “ENTRY RESERVED”

The experience is intentionally slightly exaggerated — blending serious corporate legal tone with subtle degen humor.
