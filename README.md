# Better Call Monad

An immersive dApp discovery experience styled as a lawyer's office — inspired by the visual tone of "Better Call Saul." Instead of standard lists or dashboards, dApps are presented as confidential case files in a cinematic office scene.

## Concept

- Immersive office scene with ambient sound and visuals
- dApps presented as "case files" with notes and recommended tools
- Focus on storytelling and discovery rather than conventional navigation

## Features

- Cinematic UI: animations, ambient soundtrack, and hand-crafted visuals
- Case-style presentation: title, confidential notes, and recommended tools
- Progressive content: future case files marked as reserved

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript
- Styling: Custom CSS (no UI libraries)
- Assets: Original visuals and ambient audio
- Deployment: Vercel (demo link below)

## Quick Start

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build (optional):
